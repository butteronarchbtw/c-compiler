# my own c compiler

really nothing special just wanted to keep my programming skills up to date while not having enough time to code that often :(

## source 

i'm following this excellent tutorial by nora sandler: [https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html)

i really like the style of showing the language theoretical and assembly information that is necessary to understand what the code should do but leaving it open to the reader on actually how to implement it, this helps a lot when learning a new language

## progress

this will be very slow since i don't have any time to really be eager to finish this project
